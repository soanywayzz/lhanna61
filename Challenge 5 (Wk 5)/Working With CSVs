#3. Working with CSV
#Using the Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Dry Air Mole Fractions from quasi-continuous daily measurements at Mauna Loa, Hawaii dataset, 
#obtained from here (https://github.com/datasets/co2-ppm-daily/tree/master/data).
#Using Python (csv) calculate the following:
#Annual average for each year in the dataset.
#Minimum, maximum and average for the entire dataset.
#Seasonal average if Spring (March, April, May), Summer (June, July, August), Autumn (September, October, November) and Winter 
#(December, January, February).
#Calculate the anomaly for each value in the dataset relative to the mean for the entire timeseries.
