  Description:
    Abstract: This data set is a complete digital hydrologic unit boundary layer to the Subwatershed (12-digit) 6th level for the State of Rhode Island. This data set consists of geo-referenced digital data and associated attributes created in accordance with the "FGDC Proposal, Version 2.0 - Federal Standards For Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries 10/01/04"(http://www.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/huc_data.html). Polygons are attributed with hydrologic unit codes for 4th level sub-basins, 5th level watersheds, 6th level subwatersheds, name, size, downstream hydrologic unit, type of watershed, non-contributing areas, flow modification, and local area watershed names.
    Purpose: The Watershed and Subwatershed hydrologic unit boundaries provide a uniquely identified and uniform method of subdividing large drainage areas. The smaller sized 6th level sub-watersheds (up to 40,000 acres) are useful for numerous application programs supported by a variety of local, State, and Federal Agencies. This data set is intended to be used as a tool for water-resource management and planning activities, particularly for site-specific and localized studies requiring a level of detail provided by large-scale map information. The dataset will be appended to a larger seamless nationally consistant geospatial database as other states complete their portion of the watershed boundary dataset.
    Supplemental_Information: Please note that this dataset consists of data that were originally downloaded from the USDA Geospatial Data Gateway (http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov) then modified before posted for redistribution by RIGIS.  In addition, this metadata record was originally published by NRCS and has also been modified for redistibution by RIGIS.  Please see the Lineage section of these metadata for details.  Please also visit the USDA Geospatial Data Gateway for review additional data that may be of use, including regional watershed boundary data.

  Data_Set_Credit: Funding for the Rhode Island Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) was provided by the USDA-NRCS,USEPA. Representatives from the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management contributed a substantial amount of time and salary towards quality review of the dataset.
  Native_Data_Set_Environment: Microsoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.2.2.1350
Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Polygon identifiers are manually checked with the original base map using the attribute file. Verification on polygon identification continuity on each side of a neatline is done visually on the screen as adjacent quad representations are assembled into larger area data layers.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    features stored in an ESRI File Geodatabase format represent watershed boundaries digitized in compliance with the "Federal Standards for Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries; Verion 2, October1, 2004"
    The following topological reviews have been succesfully completed:
    Create a new topology inside this geodatabase feature dataset.  Associate the arc, polygon and centroid feature classes with this topology.
    Rank the arc feature class with a 1.
    Rank the polygon feature class with a 2.
    Rank the centroid feature class with a 1.
    Apply topology rules to arcs and polygons:
    To the arcs, apply these rules:
    Must Not Overlap
    Must Not Intersect
    Must Not Have Dangles
    Must Not Have Pseudos
    Must Not Self-Overlap
    Must Not Self-Intersect
    Must be covered by boundary of (polygon file)
    To the polygons, apply these rules:
    Must Not Overlap
    Must Not Have Gaps
    Boundary must be covered by (arc file)
  Completeness_Report: All fields for all polygons in the polygon attribute table are attributed. Some polygons in the Ncontrb_a field might have a 0 value. All fields for the lines in the arc attribute table are attributed. The lines adjacent to the universal polygon are attributed with a 0 for the hu_level. These cannot be attributed until the adjacent states complete their linework at which point the highest level of hydrologic unit can be determined.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The accuracy of these maps is generally based on the contour information of corresponding DRGs. The differences in positional accuracy between the hydrologic unit boundaries and their digitized map locations has not been tested
        Hydrologic unit boundaries generally were digitized within 0.01 inches of their locations on the digitizing source.  Edge match locations are exact because the data were extracted from a New England-based hydrologic units layer which had been electronically edge-matched.

        Rhode Island Geographic Information System (RIGIS) coverages for Basins and Subbasins (S44hdb90 and S44hsb90) were modified to fit standards for HUC -- aggregation to create appropriate HUC levels.
        Documentation for the RIGIS coverages is poor, however the data was the result of a cooperative effort between NRCS (Warwick), USGS-Water Resource Division (Providence),  RI Water Resource Board,  RI Division of Statewide Planning and the RI Dept of Environmental Management
        Watershed boundaries were hand drafted onto mylar  quad maps and manually digitized

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Basin coverages from MA and CT were edge-matched to the RI HUC8.   Since the Blackstone (?PJ - 2007) and Quinebaug Subbasins do not drain into RI, few subdivisions were made past the HUC8 level.  HUC 10 and HUC 12 delineations were made by NRCS staff to match CT and MA HUC 10 and 12 delineations.  On-screen digitizing  was done over DRG basemap

      Process_Description: Draft HUC maps were presented to the major data users in the state for review.  Agreement was reached among the agencies (local, state and federal) that the proposed 8, 10 and 12 level units met the standard for HUC  with the exception of the coastal areas since the standard for the delineation  of coastal areas has not been approved.  The coastal delineations will need to be re-visited once the standard is established

      Process_Description:
        HUC12 watershed boundaries for all watersheds intersecting RI were edited/updated by EPA Region 5 in order to meet that agencies regulatory data needs.  All work was performed in accordance with reguirements & standards set forth in the "Federal Standards for Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries; Version 2.0, October 1, 2004.
        All edits were reviewed and verified by the RI Dept of Environmental Management and the Warwick, RI office of NRCS.  With one exception, the resulting watershed boundaries do not conflict with the certified WBD of neighboring states.  The exception occurs in the 6th level watersheds identified as follows: 010900030207, 010900040401 and 010900030208.  The areas draining to "Cranberry Ponds" and thence to "Happy Hollow Pond" required alteration and will need to be resolved with the certified WBD for Massachusetts.

      Process_Description: HUC12 watershed boundary data were downloaded from the USDA Geospatial Data Gateway (http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov).  After verifying the projection of the data, the data were appended together and then the HUC12 watersheds that intersect the Rhode Island state boundary were identified and extracted.  Local watershed names provided by Paul Jordan at the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management were joined to these data using the HUC12 code as the join field.  State-specific metadata available from NRCS (ftp://ftp.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/pub/wbd/hu/metadata/ri_hu12.met) were edited to include RIGIS distribution information and attribute information about the RIDEM-supplied local watershed names.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      This is a description of attributes by field from the Federal Standards for Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries
      1) Polygon attributes
      Huc_8 : Eight Digit Hydrologic Unit Code
      A unique 8-digit code from the USGS map series "Hydrologic Unit Maps".  The same number was used in every record that pertains to a subwatershed that resides within the same 8-digit sub-basin.Numbers were assigned in an upstream to downstream fashion. Where no downstream/upstream relationship could be determined numbers were assigned in a clockwise fashion.
      Huc_10:	Ten Digit Hydrologic Unit Code
      This field provides a unique 10-digit code for each watershed.  This same number was used in every record that pertains to a subwatershed that resides within the same 10-digit watershed. Numbers were assigned in an upstream to downstream fashion. Where no downstream/upstream relationship could be determined numbers were assigned in a clockwise fashion.
      Huc_12:	Twelve Digit Hydrologic Unit Code
      This field provides a unique 12-digit code for each subwatershed.  Numbers were assigned in an upstream to downstream fashion. Where no downstream/upstream relationship could be determined numbers were assigned in a clockwise fashion.
      Acres: 	Acres
      Area of subwatershed including non-contributing areas calculated to acres as a whole number, no decimals.  The "Acres" field was calculated from the "Area" field.
      States: 	States
      The "States" field includes the names of all state(s) that the subwatershed falls within.  The 2-digit postal abbreviation in upper case and in alphabetical order was used, separated with a comma.
      Ncontrb_a: Non-Contributing Area
      Drainage areas that do not flow toward the outlet of any hydrologic unit are considered non-contributing.  If a non-contributing area is on the boundary between two or more hydrologic units, the non-contributing area is associated with the hydrologic unit adjacent to the low point on the boundary. This attribute should be the total of the non-contributing areas within a hydrologic unit calculated in acres.
      Hu_10_ds: Fifth Level Downstream Hydrologic Unit Code
      This field has the 10-digit code of the 5th level hydrologic unit that is receiving the majority of the flow from the watershed that the 6th level HU falls within.  Outlets created by ditching or other artificial drainage were not considered for this field. If an HU flows into an ocean or the Gulf of Mexico, this field was populated with "OCEAN" and if a HU flows into one of the Great Lakes the term "LAKE" was used.  If a HU flows across international borders, "CANADA" or "MEXICO" was used depending on which country the HU drains into.  If an HU is  a closed basin, then the term "CLOSED BASIN"was used.
      Hu_10_name: Fifth Level Hydrologic Unit Name
      This field used officially recognized names only.  This field was populated by following the directions in subsection 6.3 "Watershed and Subwatershed Naming Protocol".  The name used to attribute the watershed was used only once within a 4th level unit.
      Hu_10_mod: Fifth Level Hydrologic Unit Modifications
      This field identifies any type of modifications to natural overland flow that alters the location of the hydrologic unit boundary for a 10-digit watershed.  This field shows the most significant to least significant modification(s) to the watershed boundary.  One or more of the following abbreviations was used.
      SC - Stormwater Canal
      ID - Irrigation Ditch

      Hu_10_type:    Fifth Level Hydrologic Unit Type
      This field was populated with the hydrologic unit type from the list provided that most closely identifies the watershed.
      S - "Standard" hydrologic unit - Any land HU with drainage flowing to a single outlet point, excluding non-contributing areas. This includes areas or small triangular wedges between adjacent HU's that remain after classic hydrologic units are delineated.  Some examples include "true", "classic", "composite", and "remnant" hydrologic units.
      C - "Closed Basin" hydrologic unit - A drainage area that is 100% non-contributing. This means all surface flow is internal, no overland flow leaves the hydrologic unit through the outlet point.
      F - "Frontal" hydrologic unit - Areas along the coastline of lakes, oceans, bays, etc. that have more than one outlet.  These HU's are predominantly land with some water areas at or near the outlet(s).
      W - "Water" hydrologic unit - Hydrologic units that are predominantly water with adjacent land areas, ex. lake, easturies, harbors.
      I - "Island" hydrologic unit - A hydrologic unit that is one or more islands and adjacent water out to the toe of the shore face.
      U - "Unclassified" hydrologic unit - A hydrologic unit that can't be defined or doesn't fit into one of the types that have been listed.
      Hu_12_ds:   Sixth Level Downstream Hydrologic Unit Code
      This field was populated with the 12-digit code of the 6th level hydrologic unit that is receiving the majority of the flow from the subwatershed.  Outlets created by ditching or other artificial drainage were not considered for this field.  If a HU flows into an ocean or the Gulf of Mexico it was populate with "OCEAN" and if a HU flows into one of the Great Lakes the term "LAKE" was used.  If a HU flows across international borders, "CANADA" or "MEXICO" was used depending on which country the HU drains into.

      2) Line attributes
      Hu_level:	Hydrologic Unit Level
      This field provides the means to create cartographically pleasing maps.  This field is populated with the highest hydrologic unit level (smallest number) for the line (arc) represented by the record.  The attribute was recorded using numbers 1 through 6 representing each level with 1 being the highest and 6 the lowest level.  An example would be if a line represents a region, subregion, basin, subbasin, watershed, and subwatershed boundary, then this cell was populated with a 1 (Region).  Below is a list of numbers used for each level.
      Level    Digit#       Name
      1          2          Region

      Meta_id:	Metadata ID Number
      The Metadata ID is a code that identifies which metadata file applies to the arc. In most cases there is only one metadata file. However, in some cases more than one metadata file was used to identify different groups and/or procedures used to produce the lines. The metadata ID is a 4-character code starting with the 2-letter state postal code, followed by a 2-digit sequence number. For example "OK01", "ID02", etc
